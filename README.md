ðŸš€ My First Kotlin Steps: Interactive Frameworks List  In my early steps with Kotlin, I've crafted an interactive console app to manage web development frameworks. Add, remove, search, and verify frameworks in the list. Experience my journey through Kotlin's versatility and my coding enthusiasm. ðŸŒŸ

Compiling and Running Kotlin:

    Open your terminal.
    Navigate to the directory where you have your Kotlin file (e.g., hello.kt).
    Compile the Kotlin file using the command:

    php

kotlinc hello.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar

This will compile your Kotlin file and generate a JAR file named hello.jar.
Run the JAR file using the command:

        java -jar hello.jar

    Interactive Use in Terminal:
        To interact with the interactive functions you've created, run your Kotlin program in the terminal.
        Follow the instructions in the terminal to choose options and perform actions based on the function you want to use.

Remember that you need to have Kotlin and Java installed on your system. If you're using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you've already installed Kotlin and Java according to the previous instructions.

Now you'll be able to enjoy your interactive program in any terminal and make the most of the functionalities you've implemented!
